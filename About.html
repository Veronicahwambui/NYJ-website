        <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>  
        <blockquote ><q>
          Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work.
         I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end 
         of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually itâ€™ll pay off.
         It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your 
         hard work will pay off.</q>
