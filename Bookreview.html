         Trevor noah is  a intersting book compelling ... by turns alarming , sad and funny <br>
         is not just an unnerving account of growning up in south Africa under apartheid ,but a love    <br>
         letter to the author's remarkable mother.One of the laws during apartheid a period of segregation<br> 
         in South African was that there Should be no interracial sex. Authorities would imprison men <br>
         and women who broke this rule.Trevour Noah was born in this world in 1984, his father was a white<br>
         man of Dutch descent,and his mother was a black woman of the Xhosa tribe, such union was punishable<br>
         by five yearsin prison which made his very existence proof of the crime they had committed.<br>

     <h3><b>How women are described in the society</b></h3>
     <p>
      Trevor Noah the author explain why Abel wanted a traditional marriage
      with a traditional wife according to the traditional Africa society.
      In society, women should be subservient to their husbands. Abel
      wants a woman that he could rule a woman who is free because his 
      dream is to put her in a cage. In society, women should stay<br>
      home and  their response are to take care of the children, she is 
      expected toserve  her husband, cooking in my opinion they should 
      also work and get money not only staying at home. I the book, we see
      how the whole tradition of women bowing to the men Patricia found it 
      an unreasonable thing to but she didn't refuse to do it.Women are <br>
      blower to their husband it symbolized respect to their husband but not 
      the husband to make them servant in the house.<br>
 </p>
 
      <p> 
        Going back to the book Abel  started  putting the dogs in
        the yard it was a way of saying they were going to<br>
        do thing the way Abel's want. Women in the society are <br>
        supposed to listen to their husband and hear want their <br>
        want but I suppose women should also talk and give an
        opinion in the house because the voice of the woman should be heard.<br>
        Abel wanted a woman who will be subordinate to him <br>

     <h3>How humour is used in  born crime</h3>
     <p>
       When Trevor Noah was narrating the  story he says where her mother gave birth to him the doctor said<br>
      That's a very light-skinned baby. He was  a half-white child , half black and the mother was  black <br>
      humor is used when "The doctor took her up to the delivery room cut open her belly and reached in and<br>
      pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of  laws, status, and  regulations there<br>
      his name, I was born a crime. "<br>
    </p>

    <p> 
      In the instance where Trevor Noah he did not want to  go to church, because the car breaks down, and <br>
      Jesus rested so he meant they should rest." the Lord knows that today we shouldn't go to  church, which<br>
      is why he made sure the car wouldn't start so that we stay at home as a family
      and take a day of rest because even the lord rested"<br>
       </p>
    <p>  
      Noah explained   how  his father  one day run away  from him and when he was with his mother her mother <br>
      when they were  in  the  park he   was calling  his  father and  his father   panicked and ran  away  from <br>
      He and Trevor thought is a game he kept on chasing his father not knowing why his father was running away<br>.
      "We were in the park, he was walking a good bit away from us and I ran after him screaming "Daddy! Daddy! ,<br>
      People started looking. He panicked and ran away. I thought it was a game and kept chasing him. "<br>
    </p>
    <p>  
      Humour has portrayed itself when  Trevor was in Maryvale school and it was a catholic school, he was not allowed to take communion, because he wasn't catholic.
      other kids could   eat Jesus body and drink  Jesus blood but he couldn't, he wanted to make up for   all the other times he could not  Jesus blood and Jesus
      One morning before mass I decided, I'm going to get myself some Jesus’s blood and Jesus’s body. I snuck behind  the altar and  I   drank the entire  bottle  of
      grape juice and I ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times  that I couldn't."

     Humor show itself when  Trevour  and Tom were going  to see a talent show .Trevour had told tom that he 
     had a pair of timberland boots that he had bought.Nowone had  timberland in South Africa   it was possible 
     get,but everyone wanted them  because American rappers wore them  that time  in talent show trevour after being 
     called by tom  performer onthe stage he didn't know he was  ."we ve got  a special performer, a rapper allthe way
     from American ","Tom had  failed to tell me that he'd told those  people  he was  bringing a famous  rapper from 
     American to come rap in the talent show. "
